This website is a work in progress.  The real website which is newestamericans.com has additional pages that can be clicked such as the mobile nav bar as well as every picture
in the Story page, pictures from the main page, etc.  The email submission form in the footer is inactice.  
I'm only aiming to do the main page as well as 4 pages that can be clicked from the side bars.

Index.html, Stories.html(image sizing), and about.html(getting video to work from background-url) is almost complete.
Engagement and Education are mostly imitating the original website except for the exact font-family.
