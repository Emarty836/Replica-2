This website is a work in progress.  The real website which is newestamericans.com has additional pages that can be clicked such as the mobile nav bar as well as every picture
in the Story page, pictures from the main page, etc.  The email submission form in the footer is inactice.  
I'm only aiming to do the main page as well as 4 pages that can be clicked from the side bars.

All
-finishing the exact font or very similar to the real page
-have fixed logo and social icons display when scrolling up (Javascript)

Main
-figure out how to have the section freeze while the text is between the top and bottom of the page (Javascript).

Stories
-mobile responsive(grid organization and height of the grid div
-figuring out how to reshape the image
